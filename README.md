# Interview

The goal of this application is to create a image carousel. Please create the carousel using two buttons (Previous / Next).

The Previous button will go back 1 image in the carousel. Once you get to the first image, clicking previous again will show the last image.

The Next button will go forward 1 image in the carousel. Once you get to the last image, clicking next again will show the first image.
